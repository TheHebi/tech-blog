3. If you have an accout log in with your credentials, otherwise click the sign up link and make an account

unfortunately, due to time contraints and working on a class project, new posts are currently not properly linking to the user who made them. To see an example of being able to both edit and delete a post, use the login name `nate` with the password `password` this account has several posts that can be editted or deleted as a demonstration of those functions working.
